# Installation of the openEO R-Client

The openEO R-Client is available on CRAN. Install via `install.packages("openeo")`.

In case you want to use a specific version of the R-Client you can install it from the [openEO github repository](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-r-client).

It can be installed via `remotes::install_github()`. For the dev version set `remotes::install_github(repo="Open-EO/openeo-r-client",ref="develop", dependencies=TRUE)`.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("openeo")
packageVersion("openeo") >= '1.2.0'
```

## Useful libraries

Load the openEO R-Client library and some other useful libraries.

```{r libs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(openeo)
library(stars)
library(sf)
library(mapview)
library(mapedit)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(leaflet)
library(leafem)
```

# Authentication and Login

## Authentication

Before you can use openEO Platform you need a user account to authenticate yourself. To handle authentication, openEO leverages [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/). The [general authentication documentation for openEO Platform](https://docs.openeo.cloud/authentication/#authentication) describes the authentication procedure in more detail.

## Login

First connect to the backend. This allows to discover the collections (as seen in the connections pane) and the processes.

In a second step log in. This allows to use the full functionality of openEO Platform including processing. Slight differences will occur depending on the type of account you have (e.g., free tier, early adopter).

```{r connect_and_login}
host = "https://openeo.cloud"
con = openeo::connect(host)
login()
```

Sometimes it's useful to get your account information and check whether you are still logged in.

```{r check_login}
describe_account()
con$isConnected()
con$isLoggedIn()
```

# Discovery of collections and processes

Once you're connected you can discover processes and collections. This gives you valuable metadata on collections and information on how to use the processes.

## Discover collections

The collections appear in the connections pane of R-Studio. You can also list them via `list_collections()` directly:

```{r list_collections}
list_collections()
```

For the full metadata of a single collection, use `describe_collection()`.

```{r describe_collection}
coll_meta = openeo::describe_collection("SENTINEL2_L1C_SENTINELHUB")
coll_meta
```

To use the collection metadata for further coding you can use the content of `describe_collection()`.

```{r describe_collection}
ext = coll_meta$extent$spatial # you could use this to draw a bbox of the collection
st_bbox(obj = c(xmin = ext[1], ymin = ext[2], xmax = ext[3], ymax = ext[4]), crs = 4326) %>% mapview()

```

## Discover processes

To get an overview of the available processes use `list_processes()`

```{r list_processes}
# list_processes opens in the notebook
list_processes()
# process_viewer in the viewer window
process_viewer()
```

# Processing

-   Load Sentinel 2 L1C data
-   Define the area of interest, temporal range and bands
-   Atmospherically correct the values on the fly
-   Calculate the NDVI
-   Aggregate temporal means
-   Download the result

## Definitions

First define an area of interest interactively (either a point or area). You can also use multiple features and loop through them later on.

```{r aoi_process}
# this is interactive
pnts = mapedit::drawFeatures()

# this is static for areas - Bonn
# pnts = c(xmin = 6.631536, ymin = 50.811346, xmax = 6.646557, ymax = 50.821710)
# pnts = st_bbox(pnts, crs = st_crs(4326))

mapview(pnts)
```

A bit of formatting.

```{r def_bbox}
bbox = st_bbox(pnts)
bbox = list(west = bbox[[1]],
            east = bbox[[3]],
            south = bbox[[2]],
            north = bbox[[4]])
```

Define the collection (data set), time range and bands.

```{r defs_process}

collection = "SENTINEL2_L2A" # only for Belgium
bands = c("B04", "B08")

# The extensive list of bands is only needed if atmospheric correction is applied.
# collection = "SENTINEL2_L1C_SENTINELHUB" # for atmospheric_correction, takes a while
# bands = c("B04", "B08", "CLP", "B09", "B8A", "B11",
#           "sunAzimuthAngles", "sunZenithAngles", "viewAzimuthMean", "viewZenithMean")

time_range = list("2018-01-01", 
                  "2019-01-01")

```

## Build the processing chain

Start building the processing chain. First, load the available processes. You can access the available processes assigned to `p` here via the `$` operator.

⚠️ Auto-completion is a very helpful feature ⚠️

```{r load_processes, eval=FALSE}
p = openeo::processes()
```

Load the collection.

```{r load_data, eval=FALSE}
data = p$load_collection(id = collection, 
                         spatial_extent = bbox,
                         temporal_extent = time_range, 
                         bands = bands) 
#, properties = list("eo:cloud_cover" = function(x){x < 35})) # for the whole scene, not the aoi
# The different processes can be also chained using the pipe %>%.
  
```

Atmospherical Correction on the fly. Only works for collections that support/need atmospheric correction (e.g., "SENTINEL2_L1C_SENTINELHUB) and the necessary bands need to be available in the data cube (see extended band list above).

```{r atmopspherical_correction, eval=FALSE}
# takes too long, for the demo since has to work on whole tile
# atm_corr = p$atmospheric_correction(data = data, method = "smac") # or use "iCor"
```

Calculate NDVI. Reduce the "bands" dimension with the well known NDVI formula.

```{r calc_ndvi, eval=FALSE}
calc_ndvi = p$reduce_dimension(data = data, 
                               dimension = "bands", 
                               reducer = function(data, context) {
                                 red = data[1]
                                 nir = data[2]
                                 (nir-red)/(nir+red)})

```

Aggregate to temporal periods.

```{r temporal_period, eval=FALSE}
# temp_period = p$aggregate_temporal_period(data = calc_ndvi,
#                                           period = "month",
#                                           reducer = function(data, context){p$median(data)}, dimension = "t")
```

Alternatively, calculate the mean for the whole time period.

```{r temporal_mean, eval=FALSE}
temp_period = p$reduce_dimension(data = calc_ndvi,
                            reducer = function(data, context){p$mean(data)},
                            dimension = "t")
```

Save the result.

```{r save_result, eval=FALSE}
result = p$save_result(data = temp_period, format="GTiff")
```

No processing has happened so far. Only the workflow/process graph has been defined.

```{r vis_graph, eval=FALSE}
#toJSON(as(result, "Process"))
#process_viewer(as(result, "Process"))
as(result, "Process")
```

## Register a Job, compute it and view the COG

First we register our process graph as a job on a backend. A job is created on the backend and executed asynchronously upon request.

```{r create_job, eval=FALSE}
out_name =  "r_ndvi_demo_lps.tif"
job = create_job(graph = result,
                 title = out_name,
                 description = out_name,
                 format = "GTiff")
```

Start the job.

```{r start_job, eval=FALSE}
start_job(job = job$id) # use the id of the job (job$id) to start the job
```

Check the status of the job.

```{r status_job, eval=FALSE}
stat = status(job)

while (stat %in% c("queued", "running")) {
  Sys.sleep(10)
  stat = status(job)
  message(paste0(Sys.time(), " | Job: ", job$id, " is ", stat))
}

```

Check the results of your job when its finished.

```{r list_job, eval=FALSE}
job_list = list_jobs() # here you can see your jobs and their status
result_obj = list_results(job = job$id)
result_obj
```

Download the result, or use the URL to view the COG.

```{r dwnld_job, eval=FALSE}
# dwnld = download_results(job = job$id, folder = "./") # adjust path here
# dwnld
```

We retrieve the URL of the COG

```{r url_cog, eval=FALSE}
# result_obj = list_results(job = "vito-e4bf89e9-fb93-407b-a50e-4fdfd303cdb1")
# url = result_obj$assets$openEO.tif$href
url = "https://openeo.vito.be/openeo/1.0/jobs/e4bf89e9-fb93-407b-a50e-4fdfd303cdb1/results/assets/NmRlNWRiZjY5MjVkNjI5YzQ4N2EzMDhlZGQ5N2Q2ZWFiOTBhZTBjY2NkZTY2MmMzYTEyOTE1ZjRmMTlmMDE5MUBlZ2kuZXU%3D/f0bace29870ea96f4c0931ed74848b3a/openEO.tif?expires=1653579696"

```

And finally, view the cog interactively. Currently using a custom function, a generic COG viewing function is under consideration in the package [`mapview`](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview/issues/400).

```{r mapview_cog}
source("/home/pzellner@eurac.edu/git_projects/LPS_presentations/demos/WWU_Web_Editor_Rclient/view_cog.R")
view_cog(url = url, min_scale = 0, max_scale = 0.5)
```

## Get a point time series

Define a point.

```{r get_pixel}
# define a point
pixel = mapedit::drawFeatures(mapview(pnts))
# pixel = st_centroid(st_as_sf(st_as_sfc(pnts)))

# static assignment
# pixel = data.frame(x = 6.635957, y = 50.8165)
# pixel = st_as_sf(pixel, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = st_crs(4326))

mapview(pixel) + mapview(pnts)
```

Update the process graph to aggregate to monthly values. And pick only the point.

```{r temp_period_month, eval=FALSE}
temp_period = p$aggregate_temporal_period(data = calc_ndvi,
                                          period = "month",
                                          reducer = function(data, context){p$median(data)}, dimension = "t")

agg_spat = p$aggregate_spatial(data = temp_period, 
                               geometries = pixel, 
                               reducer = function(data, context){p$median(data)})

result2 = p$save_result(data = agg_spat, format = "netCDF")
```

Check the process graph

```{r check_pg, eval=FALSE}
as(result2, "Process")
```

Synchronous call (result is computed directly)

```{r out_name}
out_name =  "r_ndvi_px_demo_lps.nc"
```

```{r compute_result, eval=FALSE}
a = Sys.time()
compute_result(result2,
               output_file = out_name, 
               con = con)
b = Sys.time()-a
b
```

# Analyze Results

## Load Results

```{r load_result}
ndvi_px = read_ncdf(out_name)
ndvi_px_df = data.frame(value = ndvi_px %>% pull() %>% c() %>% as.vector(), 
                        dates = as.Date(st_get_dimension_values(ndvi_px, "t")))


plot_px = ggplot(ndvi_px_df, aes(x = dates, y = value)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
plot_px_plotly = plotly::ggplotly(plot_px)
plot_px_plotly

```
