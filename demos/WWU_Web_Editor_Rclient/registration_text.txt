openEO Platform allows to process a wide variety of earth observation datasets in a cloud platform. This large-scale data access and processing is performed on multiple infrastructures, which all support the openEO API.
Users interact with the API through clients. This demonstration shows the usage and capabilities of the Web Editor and the R-Client.
The Web Editor is a webtool to interactively build processing chains by connecting the openEO processes visually. This is the most intuitive way to get in touch with openEO Platform. 
The R-Client is the openEO Platform entry point for R users and is available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). It facilitates the interaction with the openEO API within the R programming language and the advantages of the R-Studio IDE and Râ€™s well known geospatial libraries.
The demonstration showcases a round trip through a typical openEO Platform workflow: login to openEO Platform, data and process discovery, process graph building adapted to common use cases, processing of data and the visualization of results.
