This training will use a working Python code example to demonstrate how openEO can support a deep learning and classical machine learning use case. The use case will show how to extract agriculture parcel boundaries from Sentinel-2 input.
Learning goals:
	Collecting training data with openEO
	Training and inference of a random forest model
	Integrating a Tensorflow based model in a user defined function for inference in openEO.
Prerequisites:
	Basic understanding of ML concepts
	Python programming
