openEO Platform allows to have access to dozens of data collections from multiple satellite missions for multiple years. What are the possibilities given by this huge amount of data?


This demo will focus on building a Snow Monitoring pipeline using openEO processes.
The basic usage of openEO will be explained with some remarks on the best practices to adopt.
Different pipelines are proposed depending on the input data source (optical or radar).
We will compare results from different satellite missions and visualize them interactively.
